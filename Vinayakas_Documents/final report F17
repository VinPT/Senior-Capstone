\section{Project Overview}
The 

\section{Current Progress}
We have not yet been able to compleat and concreet progress on getting the project implemented.
This may be a problem later on.
that said we have been able to gett lots of the technology we plan to use figured out.
We have decided to use an Jettson from Nvidia and probably use there Jetpack technolagy package to get it to work.

\section{Problems}
This was not an easy term for us as a group.
The challanges of working with a group of bussy people with three verry diffrent scheduls encoraged us to work remotly from one another.
However when we tryed to do so we realized we were not that great at understanding what the other may have wanted when not communicating face to face.
This is probably the biggest problem for our group at the moment.
